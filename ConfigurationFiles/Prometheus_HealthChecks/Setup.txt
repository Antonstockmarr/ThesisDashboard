## Prometheus setup configuration

# Server setup
1. Add docker-compose.prometheus.yml file to root folder with other docker-compose.yml files
2. Change port to desired monitoring display port
3. Put folder "prometheus" into same directory
4. Go to prometheus/config/targets.json and add all hosts and ports you want to get healthchecks for.
5. Go to root folder and run
  $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.prometheus.yml up
6. Go to the monitoring display port and search for "UP". This metric is 0 if the target is down, 1 if it is up.

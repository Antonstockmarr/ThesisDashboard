## Logstash setup configuration

# Setup ELK servers
1. Add docker-compose.elk.yml file to root folder with other docker-compose.yml files
2. Put folder "elk" into same directory
3. ELK uses one port for LogStash, which is 8080 per default with the HTTP plugin. Change it in "docker-compose.elk.yml" to "8080:newPort" if necessary.
3. ELK uses one port for ElasticSearch, which is 9200 per default. Change it in "docker-compose.elk.yml" to "9200:newPort", "elk/logstash/pipeline/logstash.conf" to "ElasticSearch:newPort", and "elk/kibana/config/kibana.yml" to "http://elasticsearch:9200:newPort" if necessary
3. ELK uses one port for Kibana, which is 5601 per default. Change it in "docker-compose.elk.yml" to "5601:newPort" if necessary
5. Go to root folder and run
  $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.elk.yml up
6. Go to the port used for Kibana after the setup is complete. Set index to "logstash-*".
7. Kibana will display logs and provide search handles.

# Setup logging
1. Add instrumentation to the application to send logs to the Logstash port. Log fields are put in the payload. There are many ways to do this. In c# one can use SeriLogger.

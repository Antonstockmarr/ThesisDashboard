## Logstash setup configuration

# Setup ELK servers
1. Add docker-compose.elk.yml file to root folder with other docker-compose.yml files
2. Put folder "elk" into same directory
3. ELK uses one port for LogStash, which is 8080 per default. Change it in "docker-compose.elk.yml" if necessary.
3. ELK uses one port for ElasticSearch, which is 9200 per default. Change it in "docker-compose..elk.yml", "elk/logstash/config/logstash.yml" and "elk/kibana/config/kibana.yml" if necessary
3. ELK uses one port for Kibana, which is 5601 per default. Change it in "docker-compose..elk.yml" if necessary
5. Go to root folder and run
  $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.elk.yml up
6. Go to the port used for Kibana after the setup is complete. Select an index for elastic search (fx "logstash-*").
7. Kibana will display logs and provide search handles.

# Setup logging
1. Add instrumentation to the application to send logs to the Logstash port. Log fields are put in the payload. There are many ways to do this. In c# one can use SeriLogger.
